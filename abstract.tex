Determining appropriate charges is crucial for understanding a criminal case, and is helpful for other tasks like similar case retrieval. In this paper, we propose an attention-based neural network model to jointly utilize the fact descriptions and the automatically extracted law articles for this charge prediction task, and the ranked relevant law articles can also provide legal basis for the prediction. We automatically build a large scale dataset using public judgement documents of Chinese criminal cases, the experimental results on this dataset show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline SVM model, and the model using relevant articles also outperforms the one with only facts as input. The experiments on news data further indicate reasonable generalizaton ability of our model.
