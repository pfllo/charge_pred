 In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining the appropriate charges for a certain case under the circumstance of statutory law. This problem is important when users communicate with legal assistance systems with natural language, since we need to first determine the category of the case before giving any useful responses. We propose that judgement documents of statutory law countries like China provides natural training data for this task and we find that model multi-label document classification technics fit this problem well. Furthermore, we also find that using additional information of law articles can further improve the model performance in the system of statutory law.
