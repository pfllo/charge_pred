\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting appropriate charges of a case given only the fact descriptions as input. We argue that relevant law articles provide valuable information for charge prediction, and accordingly propose an attention based neural network model to jointly utilize the facts and the automatically extracted law articles for charge prediction. The weighted relevant law articles generated by our model can also be considered as legal basis of the prediction. By evaluating our model on the judgement document data, we find our model significantly outperforms the SVM model, and relevant articles can clearly improve the model with only facts as input. The experiments on news data further show that, although trained on judgement document data, our model has reasonable generalization ability on the fact descriptions written by people who are not legal practitioners.
