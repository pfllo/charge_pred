\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting appropriate charges of a case given only the fact descriptions. We argue that relevant law articles provide valuable information for charge prediction, and thus propose an attention based neural network model to jointly utilize the facts and the automatically extracted law articles for charge prediction. The ranked relevant law articles generated by our model can also be considered as legal basis of the prediction. By evaluating our model on the judgement document data, we find our model significantly outperforms the baseline SVM model, and the model using articles also outperforms the model with only facts as input. The experiments on news data further shows that, although trained on judgement document data, our model has reasonable generalization ability on the fact descriptions written by people who are not legal practitioners.
