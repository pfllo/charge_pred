\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposes that the public judgement documents are natural high quality training data for fact based charge prediction. Since China uses statutory law, it is reasonable to assume that finding relevant articles that can be applied to the case can help the charge prediction task. \todo{elaborate on this} Based on this assumption, we propose a novel neural network model to use both the fact and the relevant articles for charge prediction. The experiments show that our model performs better than the bag-of-words baseline model as well as the neural network model that only uses fact descriptions. We also shows that the neural network model trained on the judgement document data can achieve reasonable performance on news data.
