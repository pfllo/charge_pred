\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an attention based neural network framework that can jointly model the charge prediction and the relevant article extraction task, where the weighted relevant articles can serve as legal basis to support the charge prediction.
The experimental results on judgement documents of Chinese criminal cases show the effectiveness of our model on both charge prediction and relevant article extraction.
The comparison of different variants of our model also indicates the importance of law articles in making judicial decisions in the civil law system.
By experimenting on news data, we show that, although trained on judgement documents, our model also has reasonable generalization ability on fact descriptions written by non-legal professionals.
While promising, our model still cannot explicitly handle multi-defendant cases, and there is also a significant gap between our model and the upper bound improvement that relevant articles can achieve. We will leave these challenges for future work.


% In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting appropriate charges of a case given only the fact descriptions as input. We argue that relevant law articles provide valuable information for charge prediction, and accordingly propose an attention based neural network model to jointly utilize the facts and the automatically extracted law articles for charge prediction. The weighted relevant law articles generated by our model can also be considered as legal basis of the prediction. By evaluating our model on the judgement document data, we find our model significantly outperforms the SVM model, and relevant articles can clearly improve the model with only facts as input. The experiments on news data further show that, although trained on judgement document data, our model has reasonable generalization ability on the fact descriptions written by people who are not legal practitioners.
